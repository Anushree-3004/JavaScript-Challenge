# JavaScript-Challenge

In this code, we define a function called `printObjectProperties` that takes an array of objects and an optional property to print. The function uses the `forEach` method to iterate over each object in the array. For each object, it prints the index of the current object and then it uses a `for...in` loop to iterate over each key-value pair in the object. If the `propertyToPrint` parameter is not provided or matches the current key, the function prints the key and its corresponding value. Finally, we demonstrate the function with an example array of objects.
